# Pop-Up-Project
In this project, I built a pop-up system using Zenject for dependency injection, UniTask for asynchronous tasks, Odin Inspector for enhanced editor functionality, and MessagePipe for event management. The system is designed for easy handling of different pop-up types and smooth user interactions.
